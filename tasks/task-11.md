# Task 11: Add Blue Gradient Background and Blue Color Scheme

- [ ] Implement blue gradient background (similar to current purple gradient)
- [ ] Update primary button colors to blue theme
- [ ] Update accent colors (status text, highlights) to blue
- [ ] Maintain white card container from Task 10 over blue background
- [ ] Ensure text contrast meets accessibility standards on blue background
- [ ] Update recording state indicators to use blue palette
- **Location:** `index.html`
- **Dependencies:** Task 10 must be completed first

## Design Vision

Combine the minimalist, clean design from sun-taupe.vercel.app (Task 10) with a blue color palette:
- Keep the clean card-based layout, typography, and borders from Task 10
- Add blue gradient background (replacing the current purple gradient shown in screenshot)
- Use blue for primary interactive elements and status indicators
- Maintain high contrast and readability

## Color Scheme

**Background Gradient:**
- Blue gradient similar to current implementation
- Suggested: Light to medium blue gradient (e.g., #667eea to #764ba2, or a cooler blue-only variant)

**Primary Colors:**
- Primary Button: Blue (replace current purple)
- Status/Accent: Blue variants
- Borders: Keep black for contrast (from Task 10)
- Text: Black on white cards (from Task 10)

**Card Container:**
- White background (#ffffff) - maintains from Task 10
- Clean borders - maintains from Task 10
- Sits over blue gradient background

## Implementation Notes

1. **Background:** Apply blue gradient to body, similar to current purple gradient
2. **Buttons:** Update button colors to blue theme while keeping minimalist style from Task 10
3. **Status Indicators:** "Ready to record", "Recording", etc. in blue
4. **Contrast:** Ensure white card is prominent against blue background
5. **Recording Button:** Blue theme for active/recording states
6. **Accessibility:** Test color contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

## Visual Balance

The goal is a design that:
- Has visual interest from the blue gradient background
- Maintains the clean, minimalist card design from Task 10
- Uses blue as the primary brand/interaction color
- Keeps high readability with black text on white cards
