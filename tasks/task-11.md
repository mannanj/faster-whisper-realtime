# Task 11: Implement faster-whisper Performance Optimizations

- [x] Enable VAD (Voice Activity Detection) filtering
- [x] Reduce beam_size from 5 to 1 for real-time performance
- [x] Add automatic CPU thread optimization
- [x] Add performance monitoring with Real-Time Factor (RTF) metrics
- [x] Create comprehensive optimization documentation
- **Location:** `server.py`, `docs/optimization-guide.md`

## Context

Based on faster-whisper and CTranslate2 documentation, implemented critical performance optimizations to improve transcription speed by 2-3x for real-time applications.

## Changes Made

### 1. VAD (Voice Activity Detection) - server.py:41,84
- Added `vad_filter=True` parameter to both transcription endpoints
- Automatically skips silent audio segments
- Expected 30-50% performance improvement

### 2. Beam Size Reduction - server.py:41,84
- Changed `beam_size=5` â†’ `beam_size=1`
- Optimized for real-time conversational speech
- Expected 2-3x speedup with minimal accuracy impact

### 3. CPU Thread Optimization - server.py:12-16
- Auto-detects CPU core count using `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`
- Sets `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable if not already configured
- Expected 10-20% performance improvement

### 4. Performance Monitoring - server.py:40-50,82-99
- Added timing instrumentation for all transcriptions
- Calculates Real-Time Factor (RTF) metric
- Logs format: `[Performance] Chunk X: Ys audio in Zs (RTF: Nx, M segments)`
- Target RTF < 0.3x for smooth real-time transcription

### 5. Documentation - docs/optimization-guide.md
- Comprehensive guide explaining CTranslate2 runtime
- 7 prioritized optimization strategies with code examples
- Model comparison table
- Browser limitation explanations
- Performance monitoring best practices

## Expected Performance Impact

**Combined speedup: 2-3x faster transcription**
- Before: ~2-3 seconds to process 3-second audio chunk
- After: ~0.5-1 second to process 3-second audio chunk (RTF < 0.3x)

## Technical Details

- CTranslate2 runtime provides 3-4x speedup over PyTorch with 75% less memory
- VAD filtering reduces unnecessary processing of silence
- Lower beam size trades marginal accuracy for significant speed gains
- RTF (Real-Time Factor) < 1.0 means transcription is faster than audio playback
